# Athena: A Course Management System

## Problem Statement

”Athena”, the Greek God of knowledge and wisdom is an online service for the students
at any university. A student using this can not only browse details of the courses but also
get suggestions regarding the courses he/she can take.The user can check for slot clash
between chosen courses, their prerequisites, while at the same time have discussions
about them on an anonymous forum. The main purpose for this is to make decision
making easier for them.

The students at any university have a huge burden resting on their shoulders, which
is to prepare for their careers and an important step in that direction is taking aca-
demic courses in the university, based on their interests and aspirations. But hundreds
of courses,some which are difficult, dependent on others, or even similar put the student
into an endless spiral of decision making. So ’Athena’ will take care of all of the students
needs with respect to managing their courses and making information easily available
for them.
